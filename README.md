# ETL-Project

Project Proposal:
We intend to take the top 1000 films from Metacriticâ€™s best films of all time via web scraping. Then, use the GuideBox API to find which streaming services have those movies, and then utilize the IMDB flat files to find ratings and other tidbits for those movies.

By class on Thursday:

Chris:  Write code to bounce title against flat file to find tconst to lookup imdb rating.

Derek:  Web scrape top 1000 movies from Metacritic best movies of all time. I will create a file called Titles.csv to be used in other
programs.

Aly:  Write code to use Guidebox to find availability of the movies on the streaming service.
