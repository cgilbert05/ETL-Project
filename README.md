# ETL-Project

Project Proposal:
We intend to take the top 100 films from Metacriticâ€™s best films of all time via web scraping and then use the guide box api to find which streaming services have those movies, and then we will use the imdb flat files to find ratings for those movies.

Chris:  Write code to bounce title against flat file to find tconst to lookup imdb rating.\n
Derek:  Web scrape top 1000 movies from Metacritic best movies of all time.   I will create a file called Titles.csv to be used in other\n programs.\n
