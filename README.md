# ETL-Project

Project Proposal:
We intend to create a database of the top 1000 films that gives basic movie information along with which streaming services it is available on. We will extract the top 1000 films data from Metacriticâ€™s best films of all time via web scraping. Then, use the GuideBox API to find which streaming services have those movies available, and then utilize the IMDB flat files to find ratings and other tidbits that might help determine movies selection.

By class on Thursday:

Chris:  Write code to bounce title against flat file to find tconst to lookup imdb rating.

Derek:  Web scrape top 1000 movies from Metacritic best movies of all time. I will create a file called Titles.csv to be used in other
programs.

Aly:  Write code to use the Guidebox API to find availability of the movies on the streaming service.
